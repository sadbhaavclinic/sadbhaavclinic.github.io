<h2>Historically Famous People with Blindness or Visual Impairments</h2><p>Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological and/or neurological factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete blindness is the&nbsp;total lack of form and light perception and is clinically recorded as “No Light Perception” or “NPL”.&nbsp; Eye injuries, mostly occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye).&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are blind or visually impaired&nbsp;have devised a number of techniques that allow them to complete daily activities using their remaining senses and recently created&nbsp;accessible technology such as <a title="Open Screen Reading Software in a new window" href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screen reading software</a> enables visually impaired&nbsp;people to use mainstream computer applications including the Internet.&nbsp; Listed below are historically famous people with visual impairments including total blindness, sight conditions,&nbsp;or blindness in one eye.</p>

In 1965, Charles was arrested for possession of heroin, a drug to which he had been addicted for nearly 20 years. &nbsp;It was his third arrest for the offense, but he avoided jail time after kicking the habit in a clinic in Los Angeles. &nbsp;He spent a year on parole in 1966.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray also appeared in the 1980 hit movie, The Blues Brothers and&nbsp;Frank Sinatra called him “the only true genius in the business.”&nbsp; In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Charles number ten on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and also voted him number two on their list of The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.</p><p><a title="Back to Top" href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p><hr><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-262" title="Franklin D Roosevelt" src="https://brailleworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Franklin-D-RooseveltForUseOnBW.comFamousPeoplePage-150x150.jpg" alt="Franklin D Roosevelt" width="100" height="100"> <a title="Open Franklin Delano Roosevelt on Wikipedia in a new window" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</strong></a> (January 30, 1882&nbsp;– April 12, 1945):&nbsp;

It is characterized by abnormal growth of blood vessels, scarring, and sometimes retinal detachment.&nbsp;&nbsp;A prominent figure in popular music during the latter half of the 20th century, Wonder has recorded more than thirty <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> top ten hits and won twenty-two Grammy Awards (the most ever won by a solo artist) as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award.&nbsp; He has also won an Academy Award for Best Song, and been inducted into both the Rock and Roll and Songwriters&nbsp;halls of fame.&nbsp; He has also been awarded the Polar Music Prize.

He was Professor of Mathematics at the University of Detroit Mercy in Detroit, Michigan. Though his employers were sometimes reluctant to hire him knowing that he was blind, his reputation grew as it became apparent that he was a capable mathematician and teacher. He developed the Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation in 1952. Nemeth Code has gone through 4 revisions since its initial development and continues in wide use today. Dr. Nemeth is also responsible for the rules of MathSpeak, a system for orally communicating mathematical text. Dr. Nemeth is an active member of the National Federation of the Blind.
